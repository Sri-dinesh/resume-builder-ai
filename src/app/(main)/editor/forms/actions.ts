End Date: <YYYY-MM-DD format or "Present">

Description:
[Generate 5 achievement-focused bullet points following this enhanced structure]
- [Action Verb] [Quantifiable Achievement] by [Specific Method/Tool] resulting in [Measurable Business Impact]

Writing Instructions:
1. STRICT LENGTH REQUIREMENT: Each bullet point MUST be limited to a single line on A4 paper width (approximately 85-95 characters).
2. Start each bullet with powerful, varied action verbs appropriate for the role (technical or non-technical)
3. Include role-specific keywords:
   - For technical roles: programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, tools, platforms
   - For non-technical roles: relevant processes, strategies, methodologies, soft skills
4. Quantify achievements with specific metrics (%, $, time saved, efficiency gained, stakeholder satisfaction)
5. Highlight domain-specific expertise:
   - Technical: Technical implementations, system optimizations, code improvements
   - Non-technical: Process improvements, relationship management, strategic initiatives
6. Demonstrate progression, leadership, and cross-functional collaboration when applicable
7. Follow STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) in condensed format

ATS Optimization Rules:
1. Use standard job titles that ATS systems recognize within the industry (technical or non-technical)
2. Avoid graphics, special characters, or complex formatting
3. Spell out acronyms at least once, then use consistently
4. Balance technical skills with transferable skills:
   - Technical roles: Include both hard technical skills and relevant soft skills
   - Non-technical roles: Focus on domain expertise, methodologies, and measurable impact
5. Use industry-standard terminology relevant to the specific field
6. Maintain consistent date formatting
7. Incorporate relevant keywords naturally within context (no keyword stuffing)

Critical Requirements:
- STRICT LENGTH REQUIREMENT: Each bullet point MUST be limited to a single line on A4 paper width (approximately 105 characters maximum). Bullet points CANNOT wrap to a second line.
- Every bullet point must include at least one measurable outcome
- Each achievement should demonstrate clear business value
- Format must remain clean and parseable by ATS systems
- Use standard bullet points (•) only
- Keep technical terms consistent throughout
- Should use only bullet points (•), don't include any other formatting points like (*), (-), etc.
- Avoid repeating the same action verbs, technical terms, or phrases across bullet points to maintain variety and avoid redundancy
- For technical roles: Include at least one bullet highlighting technical implementation or solution
- For non-technical roles: Include at least one bullet highlighting strategic impact or stakeholder management
